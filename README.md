# CloudRoad
<p>
<a href="http://onthethunder.herokuapp.com/">CloudRoad</a> is a web application designed to incorporate software technology to road incidents in order to streamline the process thus lowering the resolution time of the incident.
    
Our app provides real-time data, map visualization and route algorithms that allow road technicians to solve incidents easier and quicker.
</p>

# How does it work?
  
1. **Drivers**: Drivers that have experienced an issue on the road call our company providing the most important details about the incident. (Even though we thought about automating this task through the application we ended up leaving the idea aside. A quick call is faster and much more convenient for drivers than filling an online form in the middle of the road).
    
2. **Operator**: An operator in our offices fills a form with the driver's data and mark the coordinates of the incident in an interactive map. From here our app takes care to find the car workshop with the fastest route to the incident. The operator then selects one of the proposed car technicians from that specific workshop.

3. **Technician**: The technician instantly receives a notification inside the app and an email to make him aware of the new incident. The app provides him with the fastest route, the drivers data, the estimated time of arrival and much more.

## Overview
The aim of this project is to provide an Apex Legends statistic tracker for all the players who would like to keep track of their in-game stats.

Nonetheless, there is not an Apex Legends official API yet, so we have to work with unnoficial API's that, despite being very welcomed by the community do have some limitations.


## How to display my data 
In order for the API to get players data, in-game banners must be added to each legend.

- STEP 1: Equip the following banners in one of your legends: Kills, Wins & Top3.
- STEP 2: Refresh your profile in <a href="https://apex-opgg.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">ApexOPGG</a>

- STEP 3: Repeat STEP 1 and 2 for each legend

CONGRATS! Your stats have been registered and will be automatically updated in the future!

As the API's for Apex improve, more statistics might be introduced.

## API Used
I encourage you to visit the <a href="https://github.com/HugoDerave/ApexLegendsAPI/">unofficial Apex Legends API</a> used for this project. 
Wider information about the functioning of the API can be found there. Let's give hime some love for creating the biggest Apex Legends API to date.
